what should we do in order to install the package we located somewhere (internet) :
  
 - locate and download the source code (usually compressed) 
 - unpack the source code
 - compile the code
 - install the resulting executable
 - set paths to the installation directory
 
lets take a closer look to a compilation step:

 - ./configure - creates Makefile
 - make - compiles the Makefile obtained after ./configure
 - make check
 - make install
 - make clean
 
 
configure utility supports variety of params, e.g. --help will show them
e.g. --prefix=SOMEPATH - for storing machine independent files, as documentation, data and config files
     --exec-prefix - for storing machine dependent files, as executables
     
for unpacking one uses :
gunzip somename.tar.gz - for *.gz files
tar -xvf somename.tar - for *.tar files
